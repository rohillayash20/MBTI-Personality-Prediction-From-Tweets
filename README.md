# MBTI-Personality-Classifier

This trained machine learning classifier can predict a person's MBTI(Myers–Briggs Type Indicator) personality type using an individual's social media posts like twitter posts. For better understanding and explanation of decision made in this project, a jupyter notebook is provided, which contains all the code, explanation, analysis (EDA), model performance and analysis of our trained models.

###### NOTE

For some reason github cannot render complete jupyter notebook last commit. If you are only seeing first 2 sections, I would recommend using nbviewer.jupyter.org, To view jupyter notebook click here or you can clone the repo and view locally.

### ABOUT MBTI

The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (or MBTI for short) is a personality type system that divides everyone into 16 distinct personality types across 4 axis:

Introversion (I) – Extroversion (E)

Intuition (N) – Sensing (S)

Thinking (T) – Feeling (F)

Judging (J) – Perceiving (P)

The Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a kind of psychological classification about humans experience using four principal psychological functions, sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking.

So for example, someone who prefers introversion, intuition, thinking and perceiving would be labelled an INTP in the MBTI system, and there are lots of personality based components that would model or describe this person’s preferences or behaviour based on the label.

It is one of, if not the, the most popular personality test in the world. It is used in businesses, online, for fun, for research and lots more. A simple google search reveals all of the different ways the test has been used over time. It’s safe to say that this test is still very relevant in the world in terms of its use.

### CONTENT
